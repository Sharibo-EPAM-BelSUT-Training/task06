# task06
Sixth task in **[EPAM BelSUT Training](https://github.com/Sharibo-EPAM-BelSUT-Training)**.

I learned how to do multithreading and synchronization of threads. This is a swing-application. My instructor helped me write a graphical interface. In the end I built a [jar-file](https://github.com/Sharibo-EPAM-BelSUT-Training/task06/releases).
